# Implementation Decisions

A running log of meaningful decisions made **during coding** that were not
already settled in `/docs`. Newest entries at the top.

Decisions already locked in by the design document set are not repeated here —
see `CLAUDE.md` and the documents in `docs/` for those.

## 2026-08-14 — Configuration loader lives in `config/settings.py`

**Context**: The documented repository layout (`File_Folder_Structure.docx`)
gives `config/` only two files — `config.yaml` and `.env.example` — and does not
say which module is responsible for reading them. The storage layer needs
`SQLITE_DB_PATH`, `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR`, and the Neo4j credentials before any
other layer exists, so something had to own configuration loading immediately.

**Decision**: Add `config/settings.py`, exposing a cached `get_settings()` that
returns a `Settings` object with two halves: `settings.env` (pydantic-settings
`BaseSettings` reading `config/.env` and the process environment) and
`settings.config` (pydantic models mirroring `config.yaml`'s structure). Every
`.env` field is optional with a sensible default, so a partially configured
machine still loads and each component validates only the variables it actually
needs. `reload_settings()` clears the cache, which `PUT /api/settings` will need
later.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Read config inside `storage/`* — rejected because the pipeline, agent, and
  API layers all need configuration too; it would have forced them to import
  from storage for unrelated reasons.
- *A new top-level `core/` package* — rejected because it adds a folder that is
  not in the documented tree, for a single module.
- *Plain `os.getenv()` at each call site* — rejected because it gives no
  validation, no typing, and no single place to see what the system reads.

`config/` was chosen because configuration is already its documented concern and
because the module is a true leaf: it imports nothing from any other layer, so
every layer can depend on it without breaking the one-way dependency rule in
`Component_Map.docx`.

**Affects**: config/settings.py, config/__init__.py

## 2026-08-14 — Flat top-level packages, no `src/` layout and no build backend

**Context**: `uv init` offers a packaged (`src/`) layout, but
`File_Folder_Structure.docx` specifies flat top-level packages (`extractors/`,
`pipeline/`, `storage/`, …) at the repository root.

**Decision**: Follow the documented flat layout and treat the repository as an
application rather than a distributable library — `pyproject.toml` therefore has
no `[build-system]` section, and `uv sync` installs only the dependencies. Test
imports resolve via `pythonpath = ["."]` in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`.

**Alternatives considered**: Adding a build backend and installing the project
in editable mode — rejected as unnecessary ceremony for a single-user
application that is never published to an index.

**Affects**: pyproject.toml

## 2026-08-14 — Initial commit on `main` as the repository baseline

**Context**: `CLAUDE.md` states that `main` is protected and that all work
reaches it through a pull request, but a repository needs a first commit before
any branch can be created from it.

**Decision**: One bootstrap commit on `main` containing only the pre-existing
design documents, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.gitignore` — no source code.
Every subsequent change, starting with `chore/project-scaffolding`, follows the
documented branch-and-PR workflow.

**Affects**: repository history only
