# Implementation Decisions

A running log of meaningful decisions made **during coding** that were not
already settled in `/docs`. Newest entries at the top.

Decisions already locked in by the design document set are not repeated here —
see `CLAUDE.md` and the documents in `docs/` for those.

## 2026-08-24 — Neo4j tests run against a real local container, skipped if none is reachable

**Context**: SQLite has `:memory:` and Chroma has an embedded persistent
mode, so both could be tested for real with no external process. Neo4j
Community Edition has no embedded/in-process mode — the driver only ever
speaks Bolt to a running server, and none was reachable in this environment
by default (Docker Desktop's daemon was running but its pipe wasn't ready
yet). `Coding_Conventions.docx` doesn't cover how to test a module whose
only backing store requires a live external process.

**Decision**: `tests/test_storage/test_neo4j_store.py` is a real integration
suite (no mocking) run against `NEO4J_TEST_URI`/`_USER`/`_PASSWORD` (default
`bolt://localhost:7687` / `neo4j` / `testpassword123`, matching a
disposable `docker run neo4j:5-community` instance), gated by a
module-level `pytest.mark.skipif` that probes connectivity once at
collection time. The suite runs for real wherever a server is reachable
(this session's temporary container, a developer's local Neo4j install, or
a CI job that starts one as a service) and skips cleanly everywhere else,
rather than either failing hard with no server or silently mocking away the
one thing most worth testing — the actual Cypher.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Mock the driver* — rejected; the value in these tests is verifying the
  Cypher itself (the upsert-both-endpoints `MERGE`, the same-label edge
  dedup, the two-direction `get_related_items` union), which a mock can't
  catch a mistake in.
- *Require Neo4j and fail without it* — rejected; it would make `pytest`
  fail on any machine that hasn't set up Neo4j yet, including this one
  before Docker Desktop's daemon had finished starting.
- *Use a fake/in-memory Cypher engine* — rejected; no actively maintained
  one exists for the neo4j Python driver, and Community Edition being
  genuinely local-only (Tech_Stack.docx) means the real server is always
  the honest target to test against anyway.

**Affects**: `tests/test_storage/test_neo4j_store.py`

## 2026-08-24 — Neo4j temporal properties are converted back to stdlib `datetime`

**Context**: `ItemNode.created_at` and `Relationship.created_at` are typed
`datetime | None`, but the neo4j driver returns its own temporal type,
`neo4j.time.DateTime`, for any property read back from a node or
relationship — not `datetime.datetime`. Left unconverted, that silently
violates the declared type and would break any caller doing stdlib
`datetime` operations or JSON serialization on the result (found in Copilot
review of PR #4).

**Decision**: A `_to_datetime()` helper calls `neo4j.time.DateTime`'s own
`.to_native()` method (a no-op for anything that's already a stdlib
`datetime`, so it's safe to apply unconditionally to whatever a driver call
returns) and is used everywhere a temporal property comes back from a
record — `_item_from_node()` and the `Relationship` built in
`get_related_items()`. Covered by
`test_created_at_round_trips_as_a_stdlib_datetime`, which asserts
`type(...) is datetime` rather than just equality, since
`neo4j.time.DateTime` compares equal to an equivalent stdlib `datetime`
despite being the wrong type.

**Affects**: `storage/neo4j_store.py`

## 2026-08-24 — `get_driver()` closes the driver if `verify_connectivity()` fails; test suite refuses to wipe a non-local database

Two smaller PR #4 review fixes, bundled since both are narrow correctness
fixes to the same file with no real alternatives considered:

- `get_driver()` previously left the newly constructed driver open if
  `verify_connectivity()` raised, leaking a socket/thread pool on every
  failed connection attempt in a long-running process (e.g. retrying a
  misconfigured URI). It now closes the driver before re-raising.
- `tests/test_storage/test_neo4j_store.py`'s fixture runs
  `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` before and after every test. That's fine
  against the disposable local container it's designed for, but nothing
  previously stopped `NEO4J_TEST_URI` from pointing at a real instance and
  having the suite silently destroy it. The suite now refuses to run
  (`pytest.skip` at module level) against any non-localhost host unless
  `NEO4J_TEST_ALLOW_NONLOCAL_WIPE=1` is explicitly set.

**Affects**: `storage/neo4j_store.py`, `tests/test_storage/test_neo4j_store.py`

## 2026-08-14 — Blank `.env` values mean "unset", and relative paths anchor to the repo root

**Context**: Two problems surfaced in review of the scaffolding PR, both of
which every fresh setup would have hit, because `config/.env.example` ships each
variable blank and points `SQLITE_DB_PATH` at a relative `./data/...`:

1. A blank entry was read as a configured value, not an absent one. Copying
   `.env.example` gave `NOTION_API_KEY == ""` and, worse,
   `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH == Path(".")` — since `Path("")` normalizes to the
   current directory. Any caller checking `is None` would treat an unconfigured
   source as configured and fail later, further from the cause.
2. Relative paths resolved against the process working directory. The daily
   batch is launched by cron or Task Scheduler, whose working directory is not
   the repository root, so it would have read and written a *different* SQLite
   file than a manual run from the repo root.

**Decision**:

- A `model_validator(mode="before")` on `EnvSettings` drops blank and
  whitespace-only values from the input, so normal field defaults apply. Blank
  therefore behaves exactly like omitted, for optional secrets (which stay
  `None`) and for defaulted values like `OLLAMA_HOST` alike.
- An `anchor_path()` helper resolves every path-typed setting against
  `PROJECT_ROOT` when relative, leaving absolute paths as given. It is applied
  to all five path fields and to the `watch_dirs` property.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Require absolute paths and validate loudly* — rejected as hostile to setup;
  `./data/pkg_agent.db` is the natural thing to write, and it is unambiguous as
  long as the anchor is defined.
- *Anchor to the CWD and document it* — rejected because it makes correctness
  depend on how the process was launched, which is precisely what breaks under a
  scheduler.
- *Handle blanks at each call site* — rejected; it pushes the same defensive
  check into every consumer of every optional variable.

**Affects**: config/settings.py, config/.env.example

## 2026-08-14 — Configuration loader lives in `config/settings.py`

**Context**: The documented repository layout (`File_Folder_Structure.docx`)
gives `config/` only two files — `config.yaml` and `.env.example` — and does not
say which module is responsible for reading them. The storage layer needs
`SQLITE_DB_PATH`, `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR`, and the Neo4j credentials before any
other layer exists, so something had to own configuration loading immediately.

**Decision**: Add `config/settings.py`, exposing a cached `get_settings()` that
returns a `Settings` object with two halves: `settings.env` (pydantic-settings
`BaseSettings` reading `config/.env` and the process environment) and
`settings.config` (pydantic models mirroring `config.yaml`'s structure). Every
`.env` field is optional with a sensible default, so a partially configured
machine still loads and each component validates only the variables it actually
needs. `reload_settings()` clears the cache, which `PUT /api/settings` will need
later.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Read config inside `storage/`* — rejected because the pipeline, agent, and
  API layers all need configuration too; it would have forced them to import
  from storage for unrelated reasons.
- *A new top-level `core/` package* — rejected because it adds a folder that is
  not in the documented tree, for a single module.
- *Plain `os.getenv()` at each call site* — rejected because it gives no
  validation, no typing, and no single place to see what the system reads.

`config/` was chosen because configuration is already its documented concern and
because the module is a true leaf: it imports nothing from any other layer, so
every layer can depend on it without breaking the one-way dependency rule in
`Component_Map.docx`.

**Affects**: config/settings.py, config/__init__.py

## 2026-08-14 — Flat top-level packages, no `src/` layout and no build backend

**Context**: `uv init` offers a packaged (`src/`) layout, but
`File_Folder_Structure.docx` specifies flat top-level packages (`extractors/`,
`pipeline/`, `storage/`, …) at the repository root.

**Decision**: Follow the documented flat layout and treat the repository as an
application rather than a distributable library — `pyproject.toml` therefore has
no `[build-system]` section, and `uv sync` installs only the dependencies. Test
imports resolve via `pythonpath = ["."]` in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`.

**Alternatives considered**: Adding a build backend and installing the project
in editable mode — rejected as unnecessary ceremony for a single-user
application that is never published to an index.

**Affects**: pyproject.toml

## 2026-08-14 — Initial commit on `main` as the repository baseline

**Context**: `CLAUDE.md` states that `main` is protected and that all work
reaches it through a pull request, but a repository needs a first commit before
any branch can be created from it.

**Decision**: One bootstrap commit on `main` containing only the pre-existing
design documents, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.gitignore` — no source code.
Every subsequent change, starting with `chore/project-scaffolding`, follows the
documented branch-and-PR workflow.

**Affects**: repository history only
